<h3>Experience</h3>
I have been working with web design since 1998. During this time I have worked on a wide variety of projects and products of different sizes located around the globe in a range of industries, including digital agencies, dynamic startups and big high profile brands such as Vodafone, Telecom (now Spark), Toyota, V (energy drink), Westpac and much more.

I have a broad range of skills ranging from high level product strategy and design to implementation and coding. I'm a design graduate, hold a Marketing MBA, 2015 Techstars Alumni and self taught coder.

I've managed teams of designers, developers and copywriters with different cultural backgrounds up-skilling people from the most junior roles all the way up to head of design positions.

<h3>Services</h3>
I work on a variety of different projects including (but not limited to):

- Product strategy and design
- UX & UI design
- Manage multidisciplinary teams, hire and upskill people
- Rapid prototyping on framer.js, XCode, Marvel and Invision
- iOS & Android mobile app design and development
- Web design and development (Rails, SilverStripe, Wordpress and Jekyll)
- Frontend development (html, css, javascript, React, Backbone and Knockout)

<h3>Approach</h3>
I believe the most important factors to create great products are talent and passion. I'm passionate about health, education, sustainability, communities, empowering minorities and small businesses. Whenever I can, I try to find like-minded clients and partners to join forces and solve real world problems in those areas.
